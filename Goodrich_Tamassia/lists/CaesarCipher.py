# Arguably the earliest encryption scheme is the Caesar cipher, which is named
# after Julius Caesar, who used this scheme to protect important military messages.
# The Caesar cipher involves replacing each letter in a message with the letter that
# is a certain number of letters after it in the alphabet.

# Given that strings are immutable, we cannot directly edit an instance to encrypt it.
# Instead, our goal will be to generate a new string. A convenient technique for performing
# string transformations is to create an equivalent list of characters, edit the
# list, and then reassemble a (new) string based on the list

# We can represent a replacement rule using another string to describe the translation
# We can precompute a string that represents the replacements that should be used for each character from A to Z
# We can subsequently use this translation string as a guide to encrypt a message. The remaining challenge is how to
# quickly locate the replacement for each character of the original message.
# Fortunately, we can rely on the fact that characters are represented in Unicode
# by integer code points, and the code points for the uppercase letters of the Latin
# alphabet are consecutive (for simplicity, we restrict our encryption to uppercase
# letters).

# Python supports functions that convert between integer code points and
# one-character strings. Specifically, the function ord(c) takes a one-character string
# as a parameter and returns the integer code point for that character. Conversely, the
# function chr(j) takes an integer and returns its associated one-character string.

# In order to find a replacement for a character in our Caesar cipher, we need to
# map the characters A to Z to the respective numbers 0 to 25. The formula for
# doing that conversion is j = ord(c) âˆ’ ord( A ). As a sanity check, if character c
# is A , we have that j = 0. When c is B , we will find that its ordinal value is
# precisely one more than that for A , so their difference is 1. In general, the integer j
# that results from such a calculation can be used as an index into our precomputed
# translation string,
