# Let A be an array of size n ≥ 2 containing integers from 1 to n−1, inclusive, with exactly one repeated. Describe a
# fast algorithm for finding the integer in A that is repeated

# Use standard control structures to compute the sum of all numbers in an
# n×n data set, represented as a list of lists.

# Describe how the built-in sum function can be combined with Python’s
# comprehension syntax to compute the sum of all numbers in an n×n data
# set, represented as a list of lists.

# The shuffle method, supported by the random module, takes a Python
# list and rearranges it so that every possible ordering is equally likely.
# Implement your own version of such a function. You may rely on the
# randrange(n) function of the random module, which returns a random
# number between 0 and n−1 inclusive

# Implement a pop method for the DynamicArray class that removes the last element of the array, and that shrinks the
# capacity, N, of the array by half any time the number of elements in the
# array goes below N/4.

# Consider a variant  in which an array of capacity N is
# resized to capacity precisely that of the number of elements, any time the
# number of elements in the array goes strictly below N/4. Give a formal
# proof that any sequence of n append or pop operations on an initially
# empty dynamic array takes O(n) time.


# we described four different ways to compose a long string: (1) repeated concatenation, (2) appending to a temporary
# list and then joining, (3) using list comprehension with join, and (4) using generator comprehension with join.
# Develop an experiment to test the efficiency of all four of these approaches and report your findings.

#  Develop an experiment to compare the relative efficiency of the extend
# method of Python’s list class versus using repeated calls to append to
# accomplish the equivalent task

#  The syntax data.remove(value) for Python list data removes only the first
# occurrence of element value from the list. Give an implementation of a
# function, with signature remove all(data, value), that removes all occurrences of value
# from the given list, such that the worst-case running time
# of the function is O(n) on a list with n elements. Not that it is not efficient
# enough in general to rely on repeated calls to remove.

# Let B be an array of size n ≥ 6 containing integers from 1 to n−5, inclusive, with exactly five repeated.
# Describe a good algorithm for finding the five integers in B that are repeated

# A useful operation in databases is the natural join. If we view a database
# as a list of ordered pairs of objects, then the natural join of databases A
# and B is the list of all ordered triples (x,y,z) such that the pair (x,y) is in
# A and the pair (y,z) is in B. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm
# for computing the natural join of a list A of n pairs and a list B of m pairs.

# Describe a way to use recursion to add all the numbers in an n × n data
# set, represented as a list of lists.

# Write a Python function that takes two three-dimensional numeric data
# sets and adds them componentwise.

# rite a Python program for a matrix class that can add and multiply twodimensional arrays of numbers, assuming the
# dimensions agree appropriately for the operation.

# Write a program that can perform the Caesar cipher for English messages
# that include both upper- and lowercase characters.
