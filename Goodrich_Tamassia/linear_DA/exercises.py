# C-6.19

# Describe a nonrecursive algorithm for enumerating all permutations of the
# numbers {1,2,...,n} using an explicit stack


# Show how to use a stack S and a queue Q to generate all possible subsets
# of an n-element set T nonrecursively


# Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is
# initially empty. Describe how you can use Q to scan S to see if it contains a
# certain element x, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must
# return the elements back to S in their original order. You may only use S,
# Q, and a constant number of other variables.


#  Modify the ArrayQueue implementation so that the queueâ€™s capacity is
# limited to maxlen elements, where maxlen is an optional parameter to the
# constructor (that defaults to None). If enqueue is called when the queue
# is at full capacity, throw a Full exception (defined similarly to Empty).


# In certain applications of the queue ADT, it is common to repeatedly
# dequeue an element, process it in some way, and then immediately enqueue
# the same element. Modify the ArrayQueue implementation to include a rotate( )
# method that has semantics identical to the combination, Q.enqueue(Q.dequeue( )).
# However, your implementation should
# be more efficient than making two separate calls (for example, because
# there is no need to modify size).


# Give a complete ArrayDeque implementation of the double-ended queue
# ADT


# Give an array-based implementation of a double-ended queue supporting
# all of the public behaviors shown in Table 6.4 for the collections.deque
# class, including use of the maxlen optional parameter. When a length limited
# deque is full, provide semantics similar to the collections.deque
# class, whereby a call to insert an element on one end of a deque causes an
# element to be lost from the opposite side
