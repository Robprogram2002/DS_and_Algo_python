# Converting an Integer to a String in Any Base

# Suppose you want to convert an integer to a string in some base between binary and hexadecimal. For example, convert
# the integer 10 to its string representation in decimal as ‚Äú10,‚Äù or
# to its string representation in binary as ‚Äú1010.‚Äù
# Suppose we have a sequence

# of characters corresponding to the first 10 digits, like conv_string = ‚Äú0123456789‚Äù. It is
# easy to convert a number less than 10 to its string equivalent by looking it up in the sequence.
# For example, if the number is 9, then the string is conv_string[9] or ‚Äú9.‚Äù If we can arrange to
# break up the number 769 into three single-digit numbers, 7, 6, and 9, then converting it to a
# string is simple. Then A number less than 10 sounds like a good base case.

# The next step is to figure out how to change state and make progress toward the base case.
# Let‚Äôs look at what happens if we divide a number by the base we are trying to convert to.

# Using integer division to divide 769 by 10, we get 76 with a remainder of 9. This gives us two
# good results. First, the remainder is a number less than our base that can be converted to a
# string immediately by lookup. Second, we get a number that is smaller than our original and
# moves us toward the base case of having a single number less than our base. Now our job is to
# convert 76 to its string representation. Again we will use integer division plus remainder to get
# results of 7 and 6 respectively. Finally, we have reduced the problem to converting 7, which we
# can do easily since it satisfies the base case condition of ùëõ <base, where base= 10

# When we detect the base case, we stop recursing and simply return the string from the
# convertString sequence. In line 6 we satisfy both the second and third laws ‚Äì by making the

# from convertString, we modified our algorithm to push the strings onto a stack prior to making
